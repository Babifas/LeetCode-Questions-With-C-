# 2586. Count the Number of Vowel Strings in Range
You are given a 0-indexed string s that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.

There is a function shift(c, x), where c is a character and x is a digit, that returns the xth character after c.

For example, shift('a', 5) = 'f' and shift('x', 0) = 'x'.

For every odd index i, you want to replace the digit s[i] with shift(s[i-1], s[i]).

Return s after replacing all digits. It is guaranteed that shift(s[i-1], s[i]) will never exceed 'z'.

 

### Example 1:

Input: s = "a1c1e1"

Output: "abcdef"

Explanation: The digits are replaced as follows:
- s[1] -> shift('a',1) = 'b'
- s[3] -> shift('c',1) = 'd'
- s[5] -> shift('e',1) = 'f'
### Example 2:

Input: s = "a1b2c3d4e"

Output: "abbdcfdhe"

Explanation: The digits are replaced as follows:
- s[1] -> shift('a',1) = 'b'
- s[3] -> shift('b',2) = 'd'
- s[5] -> shift('c',3) = 'f'
- s[7] -> shift('d',4) = 'h'
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 100

s consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.


```csharp

My Solution:

public class Solution {
    public int VowelStrings(string[] words, int left, int right) {
        List<char> vowels=new List<char>{'a','e','i','o','u'};
        int count=0;
        for(int i=left;i<=right;i++){
            if(vowels.Contains(words[i][0])&&vowels.Contains(words[i][words[i].Length-1])){
                  count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}

```
shift(s[i-1], s[i]) <= 'z' for all odd indices i.
